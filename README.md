# real-estate-scrape example

A repository demonstrating the use of
[real-estate-scrape](https://github.com/mikepqr/real-estate-scrape) to store the
estimated value of a property on Redfin and Zillow every night using Github
Actions.

See [`data.csv`](data.csv) and [`data.png`](data.png) (above) for example output
for [594 S Mapleton Dr, Los
Angeles](https://www.redfin.com/CA/Los-Angeles/594-S-Mapleton-Dr-90024/home/6824711)
(not my house!)

**Note**: this house happens to have been on the market since February 2022, which
means Redfin is refusing to generate an estimate for it. The Zillow estimate is
recorded successfully, but the workflow is marked as failing because we don't
get both estimates. The Redfin estimate will presumably return when the house is
sold.

## Automated usage

1. Sign up for [scraperapi](https://www.scraperapi.com/) and make a note of your
   API key. The free account is enough to get started.

2. Make a copy of this repository, e.g. [using the
   template](https://github.com/mikepqr/real-estate-scrape-eg/generate).

3. Commit changes deleting `data.csv` and `data.png`.

4. Under Settings > Secrets, configure environment variables containing the URLs
   of the address on Redfin and Zillow and your ScraperBox key:
    - `REDFIN_URL`, e.g.
      `https://www.redfin.com/CA/Los-Angeles/594-S-Mapleton-Dr-90024/home/6824711`
    - `ZILLOW_URL`, e.g.
      `https://www.zillow.com/homedetails/594-S-Mapleton-Dr-Los-Angeles-CA-90024/20524417_zpid/`
    - `SCRAPERAPI_KEY`, e.g.`abcdefqwert12345`

The scraping job runs every day at 5am UTC. Come back in 24 hours and you should
find `data.csv` in your repository. Come back a few days later and you should
see the beginnings of a chart in `data.png`.

Alternatively, you can run the scraping job manually as often as you like by
clicking "Run workflow" under Actions > scrape on GitHub.
